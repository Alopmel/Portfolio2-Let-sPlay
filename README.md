# Let's Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spoke

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla.

Sam Kass explains he created the expanded game because it seemed like most games of Rock Paper Scissors with people you know would end in a tie.

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock was first mentioned in the Season 2 episode, The Lizard-Spock Expansion, the title of which references the game. It was last mentioned in The Rothman Disintegration.

As Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

To play you must choose one of the available elements and the machine will choose another randomly. Then the result of your play will be shown according to the rules on the next screen.

## FEATURES

* **HEADER**

    * The header is at the top and shows the name of the and the score that the user has, which starts at 0.

    * The name of the page corresponds to the name of the game.

    * The score will add a point when the user wins, it will remain the same when it draws and it will subtract one when it loses. If the user has reached zero, he does not continue subtracting but remains at zero until he wins again.

* **Game Board**

    * On the game board, we find five images forming a pentagon.

    * Each of the images is of a different colour and corresponds to the different elements that we have to choose from.

    * When we pass over each image it has an animation that makes the image stand out from the others.

    * This section shows the winner after the user chooses one of the options they have.
    * In the first place, a descriptive text is shown below the header of why it has won, lost or tied.

    * Below are the images of what the user and the CPU have chosen.

    * In the middle of the two images, the user's result is shown and a button that allows him to return to the initial game board in case he wants to play again.

## TESTING 

    * I have tested the game on Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Chrome.
    
    * In all search engines, it works correctly, it also maintains the same font and dimensions to adapt to various devices. So it is confirmed to be responsive.

    * Tested on mobile devices, the game works. The user can interact with the game on a touch screen.
    
    * The dimensions are also correct. The images and letters are sized appropriately so that the user can clearly differentiate them and have space to interact with the different elements.
